This is the source code for a blog entry I made a few months ago to the Electric Vine blog when I was an employee there.  See the article here: http://www.electricvine.com/blog/webdesignnj/index.php/2010/06/use-asp-net-ajax-templates-jquery-and-slimbox2-to-display-a-picasaweb-album-client-side/.  The source code was a little messed up in the blog, but this source here should be good.
